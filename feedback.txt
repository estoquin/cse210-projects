 To fix dotnet installation in ubuntu, remove all, get clean installation.
 Set one package source to install (Microsoft and ubuntu are two differents)
 And install all from the same, if not, you'll have mixed packages.

First, remove all existing packages to get to a clean state:

sudo apt remove dotnet*
sudo apt remove aspnetcore*
sudo apt remove netstandard*

Then, create a file in /etc/apt/preferences.d (I named mine 99microsoft-dotnet.pref, 
following the convention that files in such *.d 
directories are typically prefixed with a 
2-digit number so that they sort and load in a predictable order) with the following contents:

Package: *
Pin: origin "packages.microsoft.com"
Pin-Priority: 1001

Then, the regular update & install:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-6.0
